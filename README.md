## TODO

- üóπ Info button (show readme in a modal)
- üóπ Github button (link to repository)
- ‚òê Fix Line offsetting, it seems like it fails after 2 intersections. For reference check Kanda station for Keihin tohoku and Chuo rapid line.
- ‚òê Put all stations to the map (don't filter out the repetitions) and instead combine their circles into a polygon.(using intersect and union)
- ‚òê Clean unused libraries
- ‚òê Dynamic fps detection and filtering for performance?
- ‚òê Combine live data with timetables (just update the timetable for that train and continue using that data)
- ‚òê Add more sound loops
- ‚òê Add a way to save and recover creations
- ‚òê Clear audio elements when a shape is deleted
- ‚òê Add a way to upload (or at least link) custom audio
- ‚òê Change the circle animation, it's not easy to understand (maybe animate on line color instead?)
