## TODO

- ☑️ Info button (show readme in a modal)
- ☑️ Github button (link to repository)
- ☐ Fix Line offsetting, it seems like it fails after 2 intersections. For reference check Kanda station for Keihin tohoku and Chuo rapid line.
- ☐ Put all stations to the map (don't filter out the repetitions) and instead combine their circles into a polygon.(using turf intersect and union)
